          </h3>
          <p>
            I'm an early-career software engineer seeking work while bolstering my portfolio.
            I'm also a husband and stay-at-home dad to my 2 kids and 3
            fosters. I enjoy many types of board games and socializing with
            friends.

                <h4>Values & Ethics</h4>
                <p>
                  Throughout my 21 years in the military, I developed a firm
                  approach to teamwork and responsibility. I led teams, managed
                  critical projects, and made decisions when direction wasn't
                  clear. Just as importantly, I learned how to listen and grow.
                  I value feedback, stay open to coaching, and support the
                  mission from any position.
                  <br /><br />
                  I understand that trust isn't inherent, it's earned. I build
                  it through consistency and thoughtful communication. Whether
                  I'm leading an effort or contributing as part of the team, I
                  maintain my focus: improve, add value, and help the group
                  succeed.
                </p>

              <h4>Software Engineer</h4>
              <p>
                I began my journey into development near the tail-end of my
                military career when I overhauled an Access Database, greatly
                expanding it's features, capabilities, security, and user base.
                This truly sparked my interest so, while moving toward
                retirement, I pursued my B.S. in Computer Science, which I
                recently completed! I love coding and I have a wide interest in
                various fields, including, full-stack app and game development.
                At this point in time, I am further strengthening my development
                skills, completing bootcamps and working toward certificates.

              <h4>Game-Lover</h4>
              <p>
                Cool stuff I've always been a fan of games--console, computer,
                backyard, board, card, sports.. you name it, I like to play it.
                Lately, I've been getting in to adventure/strategy-style board
                games, like: Carcassonne, Catan, Castle Panic, and Blokus.
                However, since I was about 12 years old, I've loved playing
                adventure and strategy computer games. I'll be the first to
                admit that I was on the WOW bandwagon for a long time, but I've
                also played StarCraft, Rift, Minecraft, and many more. I am
                really interested in creating my own games, but so far, I've
                only had enough time to create my partially-built strategy game,
                Cube Conquest (see it in my Portfolio).
