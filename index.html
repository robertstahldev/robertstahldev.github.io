          </h2>
          <p>
            I'm an early-career software engineer seeking work while bolstering
            my portfolio. I'm also a husband and stay-at-home dad to my 2 kids
            and 3 fosters. I enjoy many types of board games and socializing
            with friends.

                  <h3>Values & Ethics</h3>
                  <p>
                    Throughout my 21 years in the military, I developed a firm
                    approach to teamwork and responsibility. I led teams,
                    managed critical projects, and made decisions when direction
                    wasn't clear. Just as importantly, I learned how to listen
                    and grow. I value feedback, stay open to coaching, and
                    support the mission from any position.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I understand that trust isn't inherent, it's earned. I build
                    it through consistency and thoughtful communication. Whether
                    I'm leading an effort or contributing as part of the team, I
                    maintain my focus: improve, add value, and help the group
                    succeed.

                <p>
                  I began my journey into development near the tail-end of my
                  military career when I overhauled an Access Database, greatly
                  expanding it's features, capabilities, security, and user
                  base. This truly sparked my interest so, while moving toward
                  retirement, I pursued my B.S. in Computer Science, which I
                  recently completed! I love coding and I have a wide interest
                  in various fields, including, full-stack app and game
                  development. At this point in time, I am further strengthening
                  my development skills, completing bootcamps and working toward
                  certificates.

                <p>
                  Cool stuff I've always been a fan of games--console, computer,
                  backyard, board, card, sports.. you name it, I like to play
                  it. Lately, I've been getting in to adventure/strategy-style
                  board games, like: Carcassonne, Catan, Castle Panic, and
                  Blokus. However, since I was about 12 years old, I've loved
                  playing adventure and strategy computer games. I'll be the
                  first to admit that I was on the WOW bandwagon for a long
                  time, but I've also played StarCraft, Rift, Minecraft, and
                  many more. I am really interested in creating my own games,
                  but so far, I've only had enough time to create my
                  partially-built strategy game, Cube Conquest (see it in my
                  Portfolio).
